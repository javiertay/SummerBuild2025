# External API Integration for Internship Tracker

This document explains how the external internships API has been integrated into your internship tracker application.

## Overview

The integration connects your internship tracker to the RapidAPI internships database, allowing users to:

- View real-time internship opportunities
- Filter jobs by location, skills, and company
- Save interesting opportunities directly to their tracker
- Get personalized recommendations based on their application history

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files Created:

1. **`src/config/api.js`** - API configuration and constants
2. **`src/utils/jobUtils.js`** - Utility functions for data transformation and filtering

### Modified Files:

1. **`src/api/index.js`** - Added external API functions
2. **`src/pages/Recommended.jsx`** - Enhanced with real external data

## API Integration Features

### 1. External API Functions

Located in `src/api/index.js`:

- `getExternalInternships()` - Fetches all available internships
- `getRecommendedInternships(skills, location)` - Fetches filtered internships

### 2. Data Transformation

The `transformExternalJob()` function in `src/utils/jobUtils.js` converts external API data to match your internal format:

```javascript
{
  id: "unique_id",
  title: "Job Title",
  company: "Company Name",
  location: "Location",
  description: "Job Description",
  requirements: "Requirements",
  applyUrl: "Application URL",
  salary: "Salary Information",
  datePosted: "2025-01-01",
  source: "External API"
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Recommended Page

The Recommended page now includes:

- **Real-time job fetching** from external API
- **Search functionality** by title/company
- **Location filtering** (Singapore, Remote, etc.)
- **Company type filtering**
- **Loading states** and error handling
- **"Add to Tracker" button** to save jobs to user's internship tracker
- **Direct application links** when available

## How It Works

### 1. Data Flow

```
External API → Transform Data → Apply Filters → Display in UI
```

### 2. Personalization

- Uses user's skills from the keyword cloud to filter relevant jobs
- Defaults to Singapore location (can be changed)
- Sorts by date posted (newest first)

### 3. Error Handling

- Falls back to mock data if API fails
- Shows loading states during API calls
- Displays helpful error messages
- Includes retry functionality

## Usage

### For Users:

1. Navigate to the "Recommended" page
2. Browse real internship opportunities
3. Use filters to narrow down results
4. Click "Add to Tracker" to save interesting jobs
5. Click "Apply" to go to the external application page

### For Developers:

```javascript
import { getRecommendedInternships } from "../api/index";

// Get filtered internships
const jobs = await getRecommendedInternships(
  ["React", "JavaScript"],
  "Singapore"
);
```

## Configuration

### API Settings

Edit `src/config/api.js` to modify:

- API endpoints
- Default search parameters
- Timeout settings

### Personalization

The system uses these skills for filtering by default:

- React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Figma

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: The API key is currently embedded in the code for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you should:

1. Move the API key to environment variables
2. Use a backend proxy to hide the API key
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Add proper authentication

## Features Added

✅ **Real-time job data** from external API  
✅ **Search and filter functionality**  
✅ **Personalized recommendations**  
✅ **Direct integration with existing tracker**  
✅ **Error handling and fallbacks**  
✅ **Loading states and UX improvements**  
✅ **Responsive design**

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the Recommended page
3. Verify that jobs load from the external API
4. Test the search and filter functionality
5. Try adding a job to your tracker

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **API Rate Limiting**: If you see 429 errors, wait a few minutes before trying again
2. **Network Issues**: Check your internet connection
3. **API Key Issues**: Verify the API key is valid in `src/config/api.js`

### Debug Mode:

Check the browser console for detailed error messages and API response logs.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- Backend caching of API responses
- More sophisticated filtering options
- Job alerts and notifications
- Integration with more job boards
- Advanced matching algorithms
- User preference learning
